  <h3>The simplest order management system on the web!</h3>
  
  <h2>Important Notice</h2>
  
  <p>SimpleOMS is <i>not</i> ready for public use and distribution. It's still in beta and anyone can access the admin panel and mark everything as done.</p>
  
  <p>If you want to use SimpleOMS in a real production environment, please make sure that it's run locally (the public can't access it) and it's using a locked-down/kiosk browser so the user can't just navigate to the admin panel.</p>
